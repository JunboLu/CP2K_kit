We provide three input files:
(1) input_use_node_init.inp: We use different number of neurons for different models.
(2) input_use_seed_init.inp: We use different initial values in different models.
(3) input_mtd.inp: We use metadynamics trajectory in lammps for model deviation.

We also provide the cp2k input file, user could use this input module to run AIMD simulation.

When runing deepff calculation, please be careful to set environment. We have provided
submition scripts for PBS (pbs.sub), SLURM (slurm.sub) and LSF (lsf.sub) systems.
