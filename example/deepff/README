We provide three input files:
(1) input_use_node_init.inp: We use different number of neurons for different models.
(2) input_use_seed_init.inp: We use different initial values in different models.
(3) input_mtd.inp: We use metadynamics trajectory in lammps for model deviation.

When runing deepff calculation, please be careful to set environment. We have provided
submition scripts for PBS (pbs.sub), SLURM (slurm.sub) and LSF (lsf.sub) systems.
