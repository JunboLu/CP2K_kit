In general, one could use CP2K to optimize GTH pseudopotentials and MOLOPT basis sets.
However, it is not easy to realize it! We build a routine approach based on CP2K code.

The reference literatures are:

For GTH pseudopotential optimization:
The procedure is rather easy. Users just need to use the input file in example/gth_pp_opt
directory, and then change the keywords. Just input an easy command: CP2K_kit input.inp.
Then the GTH pseudopotential will be automatically optimized. Users could finally find the 
optimized pseudopotential in work_dir/final directory.

For MOLOPT basis sets optimization:
It is hard for us to build a automatical approach to optimize MOLOPT basis sets. But we have 
prepared several scripts and input files. We hope those could help users.
There are two main procedures to optimize MOLOPT basis sets:
(1) Optimize gaussian exponents at first
  The input file to optimize gaussian exponents is in mol_bs/GAU_OPT directory. We would 
  variate confinment in input file. The script named 'generate_direc.py' is used to generate
  input file with different confinment. The script named 'check_basis.py' is used to check
  relatively good gaussian exponents. And then test these choosed gaussian exponents.
(2) Optimize contraction coefficients
  The input files to optimize contration coefficients is in mol_bs/COEFF_OPT.
